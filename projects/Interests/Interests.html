        <h1>My Interest &mdash; The Game of Basketball</h1>
        <p><strong>Basketball</strong> is a team sport where two teams of five players usually play both offense and defense. The goal is to score more points than the opposing team by using strategies to defend and limit the opponent's scoring while scoring more points to win the game. The game can also be played one-on-one, three-on-three, or in other formats, but not with more than five players on each team. The main objective is to score more points and win the game by using different strategies such as defensive schemes, offensive sets, roster rotation, and time management. </p>

            Why basketball?
        </h2>
        <p>I like playing basketball because it promotes teamwork, camaraderie, and discipline, and it helps not only physically but also mentally. I like how we prepare individually by mastering our crafts and training our bodies to be conditioned and able to perform at the highest level. In addition, I also like how we prepare as a team by planning strategically and helping each member understand their roles and responsibilities. Lastly, I have learned many things from basketball, especially being respectful to coaches, trainers, and teammates, as well as showing sportsmanship toward opponents. There are many more things to mention, but basketball is not just a game; for me it is more than that, it is a lifestyle and an important part of my life. </p>

    <h2>Color Choices for My Interest Page</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="blue">What color did you choose to emphasize text?</span>
            <br>
            I chose blue color in bold text because it draws attention to important text.
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class="muted">What color did you choose to de-emphasize text?</span>
            <br>
            I chose a muted gray and blue color to make less important text calm and easy on the eyes.
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class="red">How did you choose your colors?</span>
            <br>
            I picked smooth NBA-style colors for readability and a clean look. I used the built-in colors in visual studio where you can select multiple colors. I just chose what colors are good to my eyes.
