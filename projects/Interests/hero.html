        <h1>LeBron James</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.lebronjames.com/">LeBron James</a> is one of the best players and, in my opinion, the greatest of all time and the greatest all-around basketball player. He is one of the basketball players who inspired me to play basketball and fall in love with the game. LeBron was once just a kid from Akron who had a dream to be like his idol and become great. The reason he is my hero in this piece is because I admire how he approaches basketball in his life, including his mindset, preparation, gameplay, and overall basketball IQ. I also like how he treats his teammates both on and off the court, how he leads, helps, and learns from them. His basketball skills are still at a high level even though he is 41 years old now. I also admire how he helps people outside of basketball. He often says “more than basketball,” “more than an athlete,” “strive for greatness,” and “be better every day.” I especially like his preparation and how he takes care of his body and mind. It is unbelievable. Overall, LeBron James is one of the greats, a true team player, and a pass first player, yet he is number one in scoring, total points, including assists and other defensive stats, proving why he is the greatest all-around basketball player. </p>
